# Advanced Model Relationships

This concept page explores the usage of Django’s `ForeignKey`, `ManyToManyField`, and `OneToOneField` to model complex data relationships in your applications. It covers various scenarios, options, and best practices for working with these field types, enabling developers to effectively represent and manage intricate data structures.

---

## Concept Overview

### Topics

- **ForeignKey Relationships**
- **OneToOneField Relationships**
- **ManyToManyField Relationships**
- **Handling Related Object Deletion**
- **Performance Considerations**

### Learning Objectives

- Understand the usage and purpose of `ForeignKey` fields
- Explore the use cases and implementation of `OneToOneField`
- Learn about `ManyToManyField` and their applications
- Manage related object deletion behavior with appropriate options
- Optimize performance when working with complex relationships

---

## ForeignKey Relationships

A `ForeignKey` field represents a one-to-many relationship between two models. It allows you to associate a record from one model with a single record from another model. This is useful for modeling hierarchical data structures, such as categories and products, or blog posts and comments.

```python
from django.db import models

class Category(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Product(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    category = models.ForeignKey(Category, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='products')
```
````

In this example, each `Product` instance is associated with a single `Category` instance, while each `Category` can have multiple `Product` instances.

### Behind the Scenes

When you define a `ForeignKey` field in a model, Django creates a separate column in the database table for that model to store the primary key value of the related record. For example, if you have a `Product` model with a `ForeignKey` to a `Category` model, Django will create a `category_id` column in the `Product` table to store the primary key of the associated `Category` instance.

> **NOTE:** A one-to-many relationship is a special case of the `ForeignKey` relationship, where one record from the “one” side can be associated with multiple records from the “many” side. This type of relationship is very common in database design and is used to represent hierarchical or parent-child relationships between entities.

---

## OneToOneField Relationships

A `OneToOneField` represents a one-to-one relationship between two models. It ensures that a record from one model is associated with at most one record from another model, and vice versa. This is useful for modeling relationships like a user and a profile, or a product and its detailed description.

```python
from django.db import models

class User(models.Model):
    username = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Profile(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    bio = models.TextField()
```

In this example, each `User` instance can have at most one `Profile` instance associated with it, and each `Profile` instance is associated with a single `User` instance.

### Behind the Scenes

When you define a `OneToOneField` in a model, Django creates a unique constraint on the column in the database table for that model. This constraint ensures that the value in that column (which stores the primary key of the related record) can only appear once, enforcing the one-to-one relationship.

---

## ManyToManyField Relationships

A `ManyToManyField` represents a many-to-many relationship between two models. It allows you to associate multiple records from one model with multiple records from another model. This is useful for modeling relationships like students and courses, or books and authors.

```python
from django.db import models

class Student(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Course(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    students = models.ManyToManyField(Student, related_name='courses')
```

In this example, each `Student` instance can be associated with multiple `Course` instances, and each `Course` instance can have multiple `Student` instances.

### Behind the Scenes

When you define a `ManyToManyField` in a model, Django creates a separate junction table in the database to store the relationships between the two models. This junction table typically has two columns, one for the primary key of the first model and another for the primary key of the second model. For example, if you have a `Student` model with a `ManyToManyField` to a `Course` model, Django will create a junction table (e.g., `student_course`) with columns for the student’s primary key and the course’s primary key.

---

## Handling Related Object Deletion

When working with related objects, it’s important to manage their deletion behavior. Django provides several options for handling related object deletion, such as:

- `CASCADE` (deleting related objects automatically)
- `PROTECT` (preventing deletion if related objects exist)
- `SET_NULL` (setting the related field to `NULL`)
- `SET_DEFAULT` (setting the related field to a default value)

```python
from django.db import models

class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='books')
```

In this example, if an `Author` instance is deleted, all associated `Book` instances will also be automatically deleted due to the `on_delete=models.CASCADE` option.

---

## Performance Considerations

As your data models become more complex, with multiple relationships and nested queries, performance can become a concern. Django provides several tools and techniques to optimize queries involving related objects, such as `prefetch_related` and `select_related`. Additionally, proper indexing and database optimizations can significantly improve query performance.

```python
from django.db import models

class Category(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Product(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    category = models.ForeignKey(Category, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='products')

# Optimizing queries with prefetching
products = Product.objects.prefetch_related('category')
```

In this example, by using `prefetch_related('category')`, Django will perform a separate query to fetch all related `Category` instances, reducing the number of database queries and improving performance.

---

## Practice Exercises

1. Create a model representing a company with departments and employees, using `ForeignKey` relationships.
2. Create a model for a product and its detailed description using a `OneToOneField`.
3. Implement a `ManyToManyField` to model the relationship between students and courses.
4. Explore different options for handling related object deletion in your models.
5. Optimize queries involving complex relationships using `prefetch_related` and `select_related`.

# Django Views and URL Configuration

This concept page introduces the concept of views in Django and how they are used to handle HTTP requests and generate responses. It covers both function-based views and class-based views, as well as the URL configuration process for mapping URL patterns to corresponding views.

In a Django web application, views play a crucial role in handling user requests and generating appropriate responses. Views are Python functions or classes that receive HTTP requests, process the data, and return HTTP responses. Django provides two types of views: **function-based views** and **class-based views**. Additionally, Django’s URL configuration system allows you to define URL patterns and map them to the corresponding views.

---

## Concept Overview

### Topics

- Function-based Views
- Class-based Views
- URL Configuration

### Learning Objectives

- Understand the purpose and structure of function-based views
- Learn about class-based views and their advantages
- Configure URL patterns and map them to corresponding views
- Utilize URL parameters and regular expressions in URL patterns
- Pass data between views and templates

---

## Function-based Views

Function-based views are the traditional way of defining views in Django. They are Python functions that take an HTTP request as the first argument and return an HTTP response. Function-based views are straightforward and easy to understand, making them a good choice for simple views or when you need fine-grained control over the view logic.

### Example 1: Basic Function-based View

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

def hello_view(request):
    """A basic function view returning a greeting message."""
    return HttpResponse("Hello, World!")
```
````

Here, the `hello_view` function takes an HTTP request (`request`) as input and returns an HTTP response containing the string `"Hello, World!"`.

### Example 2: Function-based View with Template Rendering

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import Book

def book_list(request):
    """Retrieves all books and renders a template displaying the list."""
    books = Book.objects.all()  # Fetch all book instances from the database
    context = {'book_list': books}  # Create a context dictionary with book list
    return render(request, 'books/book_list.html', context)
```

In this example, the `book_list` function retrieves all `Book` objects using the `Book.objects.all()` queryset. It then constructs a context dictionary named `context` that holds the list of books under the key `book_list`. Finally, it utilizes the `render` shortcut to render the `books/book_list.html` template, passing along the context dictionary to make the book list accessible within the template.

---

## Class-based Views

Class-based views are an alternative approach to defining views in Django. They are Python classes that inherit from Django’s built-in view classes and provide a more structured and reusable way of handling HTTP requests. Class-based views promote code reusability, support mixins for shared behavior, and offer better organization and separation of concerns.

### Example 1: Basic Class-based View

```python
from django.views.generic import TemplateView

class HelloView(TemplateView):
    """A class-based view rendering a template named 'hello.html'."""
    template_name = 'hello.html'
```

Class-based views can inherit from various built-in view classes offered by Django, including `ListView`, `DetailView`, `CreateView`, and more. These classes provide a significant amount of functionality out of the box, minimizing the amount of code you need to write. Here, the `HelloView` inherits from Django’s `TemplateView` class and specifies the template to render using the `template_name` attribute.

### Example 2: Class-based View with Additional Context

```python
from django.views.generic import DetailView
from .models import Book

class BookDetailView(DetailView):
    """A class-based view for displaying details of a specific book."""
    model = Book
    template_name = 'books/book_detail.html'

    def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
        """Injects additional context data specific to the book."""
        context = super().get_context_data(**kwargs)  # Get default context data
        book = self.get_object()  # Retrieve the current book instance
        context['average_rating'] = book.get_average_rating()
        return context
```

This example shows a `BookDetailView` that inherits from `DetailView` and displays details of a specific book. It overrides the `get_context_data` method to inject additional context data relevant to the book, such as its average rating (assuming a method `get_average_rating` exists on the `Book` model).

### Example 3: Class-based View for Updating Data

```python
from django.views.generic import UpdateView
from django.urls import reverse_lazy
from .models import Book

class BookUpdateView(UpdateView):
    """A class-based view for updating details of a specific book."""
    model = Book
    fields = ['title', 'author', 'description']  # Specify fields to be editable
    template_name = 'books/book_update_form.html'
    success_url = reverse_lazy('book_list')  # URL to redirect after successful update

    def form_valid(self, form):
        """Executes custom logic after form validation."""
        response = super().form_valid(form)  # Call default form validation
        # Perform additional actions after successful update (e.g., send notifications)
        return response
```

This example shows a `BookUpdateView` that inherits from `UpdateView` and facilitates updating details of a book. It defines the editable fields (`title`, `author`, and `description`) and the template used for the update form (`book_update_form.html`). It also sets the `success_url` to redirect the user to the book list view (`book_list`) after a successful update. Additionally, it overrides the `form_valid` method to potentially execute custom logic after the form is validated (e.g., sending notifications).

---

## URL Configuration

Django’s URL configuration system allows you to define URL patterns and map them to corresponding views. URL patterns can include parameters and regular expressions to match complex URL structures. The `urls.py` file in your Django project and apps is where you define these URL patterns and associate them with the appropriate views.

### Example: URL Configuration

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('hello/', views.hello_view, name='hello'),
    path('about/', views.AboutView.as_view(), name='about'),
]
```

In this example, the URL pattern `/hello/` is mapped to the `hello_view` function-based view, and the `/about/` pattern is mapped to the `AboutView` class-based view.

---

## Practice Exercises

1. Create a function-based view that displays a simple message.
2. Implement a class-based view that renders a template.
3. Define URL patterns for your views, including URL parameters.
4. Pass data from views to templates and render dynamic content.

# Templates and Static Content Management

This concept page introduces **Django templates** and the management of **static content** within Django projects. It covers the creation and utilization of templates for rendering dynamic web pages, as well as the handling of static files such as **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **images**.

---

## Concept Overview

### Topics

- **Django Templates**
- **Template Language**
- **Template Inheritance**
- **Static Files Management**

### Learning Objectives

- Understand the role of templates in generating dynamic web content.
- Learn the syntax and features of Django’s **template language**.
- Explore **template inheritance** and its benefits for code reuse and organization.
- Master the management of **static files** in Django projects, including CSS, JavaScript, and images.

---

## Django Templates

In Django, **templates** are text files that define the structure and presentation of data for web pages. They separate the **presentation logic** from the **application logic**, allowing developers to create reusable and maintainable code. Templates provide a way to generate dynamic HTML by interpolating data from the application’s views and models.

---

## Template Language

Django’s **template language** provides a set of **tags**, **filters**, and **variables** for manipulating and displaying dynamic data within templates. Templates can access and display data passed from views using **variable interpolation** (`{{ variable }}`) and can execute loops and conditional statements using **template tags** (`{% tag %}`).

- **Tags** such as `{% for %}`, `{% if %}`, and `{% include %}` allow for control flow and template inclusion.
- **Filters** like `{{ value|date }}` and `{{ value|truncatechars:30 }}` modify the displayed data.

### Example: Book List Template

```html
<!-- book_list.html -->
<h1>Book List</h1>
<ul>
  {% for book in book_list %}
  <li>{{ book.title }} by {{ book.author }}</li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
```

---

## Template Inheritance

**Template inheritance** is a powerful feature in Django that allows you to create a **base template** with common elements and extend it with **child templates** for specific pages. This promotes code reuse and consistency across your web application.

### Example: Base Template and Child Template

```html
<!-- base.html -->
<html>
  <head>
    <title>{% block title %}My Site{% endblock %}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    {% block content %}{% endblock %}
  </body>
</html>

<!-- book_list.html -->
{% extends 'base.html' %} {% block title %}Book List{% endblock %} {% block
content %}
<h1>Book List</h1>
<ul>
  {% for book in book_list %}
  <li>{{ book.title }} by {{ book.author }}</li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
{% endblock %}
```

---

## Template Tags and Filters

Django provides a rich set of **built-in template tags and filters** for common tasks like looping, conditional rendering, URL generation, and string formatting. You can also create **custom template tags and filters** to extend functionality.

### Example: Using Template Tags and Filters

```html
<a href="{% url 'book-detail' book.id %}">{{ book.title|truncatechars:30 }}</a>
```

---

## Static Files Management

Django provides built-in tools for managing **static files** such as CSS, JavaScript, and images. Static files are typically stored in the `static` directory within Django apps and are served directly by the web server in production for improved performance.

### Example: Including Static Files in a Template

```html
<!-- base.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>{% block title %}My Site{% endblock %}</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'css/style.css' %}" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Content -->
    <script src="{% static 'js/script.js' %}"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

In this example, the `{% static %}` template tag is used to include static files like CSS and JavaScript in the HTML template. These files are stored in the `static` directory of the app and are referenced using the `{% static %}` tag.

---

## Practice Exercises

1. Create a **base template** with common elements like header, footer, and navigation menu.
2. Extend the base template to create specific templates for different pages of your website.
3. Utilize **template tags and filters** to display dynamic data fetched from the backend.
4. Experiment with **template inheritance** to understand its benefits in code organization and reuse.
5. Manage **static files** such as CSS, JavaScript, and images in your Django project.
6. Serve static files locally during development.

# User Authentication Basics

This concept page introduces the basics of implementing user authentication in Django applications. It covers the built-in authentication system, user registration, login and logout functionalities, user permissions and groups, and various authentication-related components provided by Django.

## Concept Overview

### Topics

- Django’s Built-in Authentication System
- User Registration
- User Login and Logout
- Password Management
- Authentication Views and URLs

### Learning Objectives

- Understand the purpose and components of Django’s authentication system
- Learn how to register new users and create user accounts
- Implement user login and logout functionalities
- Manage user passwords securely
- Utilize Django’s built-in authentication views and URLs

---

## Django’s Built-in Authentication System

Django comes with a built-in authentication system that provides a set of models, views, and utilities for handling user authentication. Here’s a breakdown of the core components:

### User Model

The `User` model serves as the foundation for representing a user within the authentication system. It stores essential user information such as username, password (hashed for security), email address, and other relevant user-related data.

```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

# Create a new user
user = User.objects.create_user('john', 'john@example.com', 'password123')

# Retrieve a user based on username
user = User.objects.get(username='john')
```
````

### Authentication Middleware

Django incorporates authentication middleware that seamlessly associates users with incoming requests and grants access to the authenticated user within views and templates.

### Authentication Backends

Authentication backends handle the process of verifying user credentials. Django provides several built-in authentication backends, with the most common being `ModelBackend` for authentication against the default `User` model.

---

## User Registration

User registration is the process of creating new user accounts in your application. Django provides the `UserCreationForm` and the `CreateView` class-based view to handle user registration.

```python
from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm
from django.urls import reverse_lazy
from django.views.generic import CreateView

class SignUpView(CreateView):
    form_class = UserCreationForm
    success_url = reverse_lazy('login')
    template_name = 'registration/signup.html'
```

In this example, the `SignUpView` uses the `UserCreationForm` to handle user registration. When a new user is registered, they are redirected to the login page using the `success_url` attribute.

---

## User Login and Logout

Django’s authentication system provides built-in views and utilities for handling user login and logout processes.

### User Login

```python
from django.contrib.auth.views import LoginView
from django.urls import path

urlpatterns = [
    path('login/', LoginView.as_view(template_name='registration/login.html'), name='login'),
]
```

In this example, the `LoginView` class-based view is used to handle user login. The `template_name` attribute specifies the template to be rendered for the login form.

### User Logout

```python
from django.contrib.auth.views import LogoutView
from django.urls import path

urlpatterns = [
    path('logout/', LogoutView.as_view(), name='logout'),
]
```

The `LogoutView` class-based view is used to handle user logout. When a user logs out, they are redirected to the default URL specified by the `LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL` setting.

### Customizing Authentication Views

You can customize these views by overriding their attributes or providing custom templates. Additionally, you can leverage the `login_required` decorator or the `PermissionRequiredMixin` to restrict access to specific views or functionalities based on user permissions or group memberships.

```python
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required

@login_required
def profile_view(request):
    # This view can only be accessed by authenticated users
    return render(request, 'profile.html')
```

---

## Password Management

Django includes features for managing user passwords securely, such as password hashing, password validators, and password reset functionality.

- **Password Hashing**: Django automatically hashes user passwords using the PBKDF2 algorithm before storing them in the database.
- **Password Reset**: Django provides built-in views and utilities for handling password reset functionality.
- **Password Validators**: Django includes several built-in password validators that enforce password policies.

```python
# settings.py
AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS = [
    {
        'NAME': 'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.UserAttributeSimilarityValidator',
    },
    {
        'NAME': 'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.MinimumLengthValidator',
        'OPTIONS': {
            'min_length': 9,
        }
    },
    {
        'NAME': 'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.CommonPasswordValidator',
    },
    {
        'NAME': 'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.NumericPasswordValidator',
    },
]
```

---

## Authentication Views and URLs

Django provides several built-in views and URLs related to user authentication, including login, logout, password reset, and password change views.

### Login and Logout Views

```python
from django.contrib.auth.views import LoginView, LogoutView
from django.urls import path

urlpatterns = [
    path('login/', LoginView.as_view(template_name='registration/login.html'), name='login'),
    path('logout/', LogoutView.as_view(), name='logout'),
]
```

### Password Reset Views

```python
from django.contrib.auth import views as auth_views
from django.urls import path

urlpatterns = [
    path('password_reset/', auth_views.PasswordResetView.as_view(), name='password_reset'),
    path('password_reset/done/', auth_views.PasswordResetDoneView.as_view(), name='password_reset_done'),
    path('reset/<uidb64>/<token>/', auth_views.PasswordResetConfirmView.as_view(), name='password_reset_confirm'),
    path('reset/done/', auth_views.PasswordResetCompleteView.as_view(), name='password_reset_complete'),
]
```

### Password Change View

```python
from django.contrib.auth import views as auth_views
from django.urls import path

urlpatterns = [
    path('password_change/', auth_views.PasswordChangeView.as_view(), name='password_change'),
    path('password_change/done/', auth_views.PasswordChangeDoneView.as_view(), name='password_change_done'),
]
```

---

## Full Example

### Step 1: Enable Django Auth App

Check that the `django.contrib.auth` and `django.contrib.contenttypes` apps are in the list of installed apps. Update `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    ...
]
```

Ensure the following middlewares are present:

```python
MIDDLEWARE = [
    ...,
    'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',
    ...
]
```

### Step 2: Setting Up URLs & Redirects

Update `urls.py` to include authentication URLs:

```python
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    ...,
    path('accounts/', include('django.contrib.auth.urls')),
    path('accounts/profile/', TemplateView.as_view(template_name='accounts/profile.html'), name='profile'),
    path("signup/", SignUpView.as_view(), name="templates/registration/signup"),
    ...
]
```

Update `settings.py` to set redirect URLs:

```python
LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = "/accounts/profile"
LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = "/accounts/profile"
```

### Step 3: Adding Template Files

Create a `templates` folder at the root of the project and update `TEMPLATES` in `settings.py`:

```python
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        ...
        'DIRS': [ BASE_DIR / "templates" ],
        ...
    },
]
```

```

### Step 4: Adding Signup View

Add the signup view to `views.py`:

```python
from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm
from django.urls import reverse_lazy
from django.views.generic import CreateView

class SignUpView(CreateView):
    form_class = UserCreationForm
    success_url = reverse_lazy("login")
    template_name = "registration/signup.html"
```

### Step 5: Migrating Your Changes and Running Your Project

Run the following commands:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```
